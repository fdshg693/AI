"""Refresh Claude documentation snapshots and write semantic unified diffs.

The two source scripts stamp their output with the current fetch time. This
helper removes those volatile lines before comparing the files so a refresh
with unchanged content is reported as unchanged.

The diff is computed against this script's own record of each target's
content as of its last run (stored under STATE_DIR_RELATIVE), not against
the live output file's current content. If the live output was changed
through some other route between runs (a direct run of the generator, a
manual edit, a git checkout, ...), diffing against it would either hide the
change (if it happened to match the latest fetch) or resurrect changes
already reviewed in a prior run (if it reverted to an older state). Diffing
against our own last-seen record avoids both, at the accepted cost of
occasionally re-reporting a change that was already picked up by whatever
other route touched the output.

Each target's diff is written to its own file under a diff folder instead of
one combined patch, so a caller can hand individual files to a subagent for
summarization rather than loading the full diff content directly.
