"""Minimal single-key `.env` (KEY=VALUE) reader shared by hook scripts.

Stdlib-only, no python-dotenv dependency, and deliberately not a full
parser -- it only answers "what's the value of this one key in this one
file", which is all `hook_log.resolve_bool_flag()` and
`inject_env_vars.py`'s `@ref` resolution need.

Duplicate keys resolve **last-one-wins** (the last matching `KEY=...` line in
the file takes precedence over earlier ones). This matches how real YAML/env
tooling resolves duplicate keys, and is `inject_env_vars.py`'s own existing
intent (see its `parse_env_yaml()` docstring) -- unifying on this behavior
here changes what used to be `_hook_log.py`'s first-wins reading of
`.claude/hooks/.env`, but no `.env` in this repo currently has duplicate
keys, so there is no practical behavior change from that side.
