  This is a curated subset of vscode-docs/output/llms.txt, containing only
  entries related to GitHub Copilot / AI features in VS Code (Chat, Agent
  mode, agent customization, MCP, inline suggestions, etc.). Section headers
  and entry order follow the source file. Entries about the separate Foundry
  Toolkit / "Intelligent Apps" extension (building/deploying custom AI models)
  are intentionally excluded -- that is a different product from GitHub
  Copilot, even though its docs also use "AI" and "Agent" terminology.
  Regenerate/re-review this file with the vscode-copilot-docs-check skill
  whenever vscode-docs/output/llms.txt is refreshed, since it can drift.
