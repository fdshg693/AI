note: >
  This is a curated subset of ona-docs/output/docs/llms.txt (the ona.com/docs
  technical documentation index), containing only entries about using the Ona
  CLI (the `ona` command) -- installation, authentication, managing
  environments and running commands from the terminal, driving Automations as
  Code via the CLI, and the CLI command reference. Unlike vscode-docs'
  llms.txt, ona-docs' llms.txt has no meaningful per-topic `## Section`
  headings of its own (just one flat `## Docs` list), so entries here are kept
  under a single heading in source order rather than grouped by source
  section. The REST/Connect API reference (api-reference/... entries) is
  intentionally excluded -- that is a different integration surface from the
  CLI. Regenerate/re-review this file with check_cli_excerpt.py whenever
  ona-docs/output/docs/llms.txt is refreshed, since it can drift.
