# Antigravity Documentation Reference

Use this skill to answer Google Antigravity questions from the official
documentation at `antigravity.google` instead of relying on training-data
memory.

## Workflow

1. **Download the official docs index**

   Run the downloader located next to this SKILL.md (run with `--help` first if
   unsure about options):

   ```bash
   python .agents/plugins/antigravity-meta/skills/antigravity-docs/download_antigravity_reference.py
   ```

   - Writes `output/llms.txt` (the official index of all pages)
   - Files fetched within the last 24 hours are reused. Pass `--force` to refresh

2. **Find the relevant page**

   - Search `output/llms.txt` to identify relevant page titles and URLs
   - The index lists URLs and one-line descriptions only — it contains **no
     page content** (the site does not publish `llms-full.txt`)

3. **Fetch the page content**

   Docs pages at `https://antigravity.google/docs/...` are JavaScript-rendered
   app shells: a plain HTTP fetch returns an empty shell with no readable
   content. Use one of these instead:

   - **Preferred — raw Markdown twin**: every `/docs/...` page has a
     plain-Markdown twin at **the same path with `.md` appended** — e.g.
     `https://antigravity.google/docs/skills` →
     `https://antigravity.google/docs/skills.md`,
     `https://antigravity.google/docs/ide/tab` →
     `https://antigravity.google/docs/ide/tab.md`. No path remapping is
     needed (this replaced an older `/assets/docs/<path>/<filename>.md`
     scheme with per-page folder remapping — see
     [docs_url_map.md](docs_url_map.md) for the retired table; do not use
     its entries, they all 404 under the current site).
   - **Fallback**: fetch the HTML page URL with a tool that renders
     JavaScript (e.g. the browser integration). If a `<path>.md` fetch 404s
     for a page that clearly exists at `/docs/<path>`, that's a signal the
     site changed its Markdown-twin mechanism again — re-verify the rule
     (try a few known-good pages) before assuming it's just page-specific
     drift, and update [docs_url_map.md](docs_url_map.md) with whatever the
     new rule turns out to be.

   Non-docs pages listed in the index (`/pricing`, `/changelog`,
   `/product/...`, `/use-cases/...`, etc.) have no Markdown twin — the
   `.md`-suffix trick 404s there too; fetch their HTML directly.

4. **Answer with sources**

   - Base the answer on the fetched content and cite the official docs URL
     (the `/docs/...` one, not the `/assets/...` one)
   - If the index has no relevant page, say so and, when necessary, explore
     `https://antigravity.google` directly

## Notes

- Scripts read and write `output/` relative to this skill directory
- `docs_url_map.md` now documents the live `<path>.md` rule (verified
  2026-08-30) plus a struck-through record of the old per-page table it
  replaced, kept only for history — don't resurrect those old URLs
